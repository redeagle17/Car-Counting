# Car-Counting-OpenCV
Detecting and Tracking cars from a video using YOLOv8 model and object tracking framework (abewley/sort).<br />
Detection and tracking are done at a region of interest.<br />
YOLOv8 is the newest state-of-the-art YOLO model that can be used for object detection, image classification, and instance segmentation tasks.<br />
SORT is a barebones implementation of a visual multiple object tracking framework based on rudimentary data association and state estimation techniques.<br />
